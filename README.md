# Launcher Project

This project is a personal initiative to streamline the process of opening multiple applications required for work or personal needs. The idea is to automate the process using a script that launches predefined applications with a voice command.

## Project Overview

When we start our laptops and begin working, we often need to open several applications, which can be time-consuming. This project aims to simplify this process by automating it. 

### Features:
- Voice command-based application launcher.
- Web application built with React.js and Node.js.
- Backend powered by Express.js.
- Local OS operations handled using a Python script.
